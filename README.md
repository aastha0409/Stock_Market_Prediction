This project is a web application designed for predicting stock market trends using machine learning. It leverages historical stock data and advanced ML algorithms to forecast future stock prices. The application is built with Streamlit for a user-friendly web interface.

**Features**
Stock Price Prediction: Predict future stock prices based on historical data using machine learning models.
Interactive Visualization: Visualize historical stock prices and predicted trends with interactive charts.
Real-Time Data: Optionally, integrate real-time stock data for up-to-date predictions (requires additional setup).
Model Evaluation: Display metrics to evaluate the performance of the prediction models.

**Technologies Used**
Machine Learning: Utilized algorithms such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, or LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks for prediction.
Python: Programming language used for developing the machine learning models and data processing.
Streamlit: Framework used to create the web application for an interactive and user-friendly interface.
Pandas & NumPy: Libraries used for data manipulation and numerical operations.
Matplotlib & Plotly: Libraries used for creating visualizations of stock data and predictions.

**Getting Started**
To run the Stock Market Prediction application locally:

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/stock-market-prediction.git

Navigate to the project directory:
cd stock-market-prediction

Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

Install the required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the Streamlit application:
streamlit run app.py
Replace app.py with the name of your Streamlit script if different.

**How It Works**
Data Collection: Historical stock price data is collected and preprocessed for training the machine learning model.
Model Training: A machine learning model is trained on historical data to predict future stock prices.
Web Interface: The Streamlit web application provides an interface for users to input stock symbols and view predictions.
Visualization: Predictions and historical data are visualized using charts and graphs for easy analysis.

**Future Enhancements**
Model Improvement: Experiment with different machine learning models and techniques to improve prediction accuracy.
Real-Time Data Integration: Add functionality to fetch and use real-time stock data for more dynamic predictions.
User Authentication: Implement user authentication to allow users to save and manage their predictions.
Extended Features: Add additional features such as stock portfolio management, financial news integration, or personalized recommendations.
